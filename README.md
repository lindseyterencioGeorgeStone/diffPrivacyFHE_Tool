# Differential Privacy FHE Tool: A Next-Gen Database Middleware

The Differential Privacy FHE Tool serves as a powerful solution for enforcing "differential privacy" on databases, leveraging **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology**. This innovative middleware empowers data analysts to query databases while ensuring that individual privacy remains uncompromised by introducing a privacy layer that adds "noise" to the query results—keeping sensitive information hidden.

## The Problem at Hand

In today's data-driven world, organizations regularly analyze vast amounts of data to gain insights and drive decision-making. However, this analysis often comes at the cost of individual privacy. The challenge lies in effectively querying databases without exposing sensitive personal records, which could lead to privacy breaches and legal ramifications. The conventional methods of anonymization and data protection often fall short, leaving organizations vulnerable to data leaks and unauthorized access.

## Zama's FHE Solution

Using **Zama’s open-source libraries** such as **Concrete** and the **zama-fhe SDK**, the Differential Privacy FHE Tool addresses these challenges directly. By implementing Fully Homomorphic Encryption, the tool allows computation on encrypted data without needing to decrypt it first. This means that data queries can be executed safely while simultaneously applying differential privacy mechanisms, effectively safeguarding individual identities against potential threats. 

This combination ensures that while data analysts derive insights from databases, they do so in a manner that protects the privacy of every individual represented in the dataset. 

## Key Features

- **FHE-powered Querying**: Execute database queries with confidentiality, leveraging FHE to keep data encrypted throughout the processing.
- **Differential Privacy Layer**: Inject noise into the results to ensure that individual entries remain indistinguishable and private.
- **Privacy Budget Monitoring**: Keep track of the privacy utilization to ensure compliance with the established privacy budget.
- **User-friendly Database Interface**: Interact seamlessly with databases while maintaining high security and privacy standards.
- **Advanced Data Protection**: Establish a framework for privacy-preserving data analysis, fostering trust in data use.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama FHE SDK**: The foundation for confidential computing.
- **Concrete**: A library for building and running FHE applications.
- **TFHE-rs**: A Rust-based implementation for those looking to leverage FHE in a systems programming context.
- **Node.js**: Asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Hardhat**: A development environment for Ethereum software.

## Installation Guide

To set up the Differential Privacy FHE Tool, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have **Node.js** installed. If not, download and install it from the official website.
2. Set up a new environment and navigate to the project directory.
3. Create an `.env` file and configure your database connection settings.
4. Use the following commands to install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This command will automatically download the necessary Zama FHE libraries along with other dependencies.

**Note**: Do not attempt to `git clone` this repository. Manual download is required to obtain the necessary files.

## Build & Run Guide

Once the installation is complete, you can build and test the application with the following commands:

1. To compile the project:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. To run the application:

   ```bash
   node src/main.js
   ```

3. To test the functionality:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

Here is a sample snippet of how to initiate a query through the tool:

```javascript
const { addNoise } = require('./privacy/differentialPrivacy');
const { queryDatabase } = require('./queries/queryEngine');

async function runQuery(query) {
    const encryptedResults = await queryDatabase(query);
    const finalResults = addNoise(encryptedResults);

    console.log("Final Results with Privacy Protection: ", finalResults);
}

// Example usage
runQuery("SELECT * FROM sensitive_data WHERE condition = true");
```

This code snippet demonstrates how the tool processes a query while injecting differential privacy noise to protect individual records.
